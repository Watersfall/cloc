Current Bugs:

  - "Too many connections" on spam click
  - ~~Making factories doesn't work~~
  - Factory, etc. costs don't fire
  
Todo List:

  - Split Factories into Civilian and Military Factories
    - Civilian produce MG and growth
    - Military produce equipment but no growth or MG
  - Factories increase in cost independently, at a much slower pace, 
  similar to mines/wells, to make MG more of a "basic resource", like RM and Oil
  
  - Population Mechanics:
    - Population growth determined by several factors
      - Available jobs from buildings
      - Population growth from food
