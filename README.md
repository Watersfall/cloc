Todo List:
-   
- Rename The Game

- Cities
    - Combine steel factories and mil factories into one building
- Alignment:
    - Gain reputation points by sending equipment and other things to either the Entente or Central Powers
    - Once you reach a certain threshold, you can choose to become aligned with one of the alliances
        - Being aligned gives you passive reputation gain
        - Makes you lose all reputation with the other alliance, and makes gaining reputation with them impossible 
            until you return to neutrality

            - Economic Bonuses
