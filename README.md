  - Split Factories into Civilian and Military Factories
    - Civilian produce STEEL and growth
    - Military produce equipment but no growth or STEEL
    - Able to build them separately at the same cost, and also convert for a set cost
  - Factories increase in cost independently, at a much slower pace, 
  similar to mines/wells, to make STEEL more of a "basic resource", like RM and Oil
  
  - Population Mechanics:
    - Population growth determined by several factors
      - Available jobs from buildings
      - Population growth from food
      - Size of military
    - Population effects on manpower
      - Higher population allows more conscription
      - More conscription however, lowers population growth
      - Mass deconscription temporarily largely increases population growth
